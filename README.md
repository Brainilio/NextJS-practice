Trying out Server Side Rendering in ReactJS using NextJS

How does server side rendering work?

1. If your page loads, it reaches out to the Server to pull out data first
2. The server will fetch & render the React App
3. Server returns rendered first page + react app bundle
4. Re-render on client (SPA)
